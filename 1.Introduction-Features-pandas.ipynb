    "To work with data sets, clean them, and make them relevant for Data Science is what Pandas do. With that, easily load and read data sets in Excel, CSV, JSON, XML, etc. formats with Pandas and work on them. Easily clean the wrong format data, remove duplicates, and do other tasks with Pandas.\n",
